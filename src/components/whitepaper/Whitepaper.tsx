                                        <p>In a world where uncertainty reigns on desolate lands and vast
stretches of dangerous desert, in the middle of an unknown world,
preceding a bloody war that has reduced human civilization to less
than nothing, vampires who once hid for centuries living in the
underworld and feeding on animal <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD, seize the opportunity to
take over the human race.</p>

                                        <p>Aware of the crucial need for a rebuilt society based on their ideals, the
vampires decide to use humans to build an ecosystem that turns in their
favor.
</p>

                                        <p>By exploiting humans for survival, they no longer have to hunt but
simply take human <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD.
</p>

                                        <p>Resulting in this new way of feeding, an obvious obsession rises among
the vampires, they are now in hunger of human <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD to feed
themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Their objective is clear.</strong></p>

                                        <p>They want to perpetuate future generations of humans and vampires
who will have known neither wars nor a pre-apocalyptic world of
equal rights, a world where it is normal for vampires to dominate
humans.
</p>

                                        <p>Seeing their inferiority in strength, the humans agree to cohabit with
the vampires and pay with their <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>In exchange, the vampires protect them from the outside world and live
in fortified castles.
</p>

<p><strong>Some humans who wanted to escape from the vampires’ yoke
fled beyond the castle walls, but it seems that strange
wandering creatures, feared by the vampires themselves,
roam the forests.</strong></p>

                                        <p>Another 40,000 Gen 1 can only be minted using <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD</p>

                                        <p>A human can live and cohabit with a vampire (staking) and generate
blood every day. He will pay with his own blood for being able to
live in the castle and under the protection of a vampire by regularly
giving him 20<span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}>%</span> (harvest) of the blood he accumulates. He will also
have the possibility to transform himself into a werewolf when he is
bloody ready to howl (Transform), without being taxed by the
vampires.</p>

<p>If a human decided not to give his blood anymore and leave the
castle, (unstake) (Can only be done if the human has accumulated 2
days worth of <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD.), He must be very careful because if a
vampire catches him in the act during his escapade, he will attack
him with instant violence making his blood spurt to the ground
(50<span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}>%</span> burn) & drink the other half (50<span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}>%</span> redistributed among all the
vampires)
</p>

<p>When a new creature (vampire or werewolf) or human enters the
territory (Gen1), the wolves & vampires already present will try to
kidnap them (NFT steal). If the attack is successful, a vampire or a
werewolf will take the reward for the hunt.
The werewolf is a rare lone hunter and one of the largest predators
among strange creatures. It contains a high-risk high rewards
mechanic, which allows it to attack vampires. The more vampires he
decides to attack, the less likely he is to succeed.</p>

<p>When the werewolf succeeds in attacking a vampire, the vampire
pledges allegiance to the werewolf for 24 hours, during which the
vampire will give the werewolf the tax harvested on humans.</p>

                                        <h3 className="wpminiting text-center mt-4">Minting</h3>
                                        <p>We decided to experiment with a new method regarding
GEN1 and mint prices, with the traditional status :</p>

<p>1 to 10,000 (Gen 0)<br />
10,001 to 20,000 (Gen 1) 20,000 <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD <br />
20,001 to 40,000 (Gen 1) 40,000 <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD <br />
40,001 to 50,000 (Gen 1) 80.000 <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD</p>

<p>We are considering implementing a progressive increase
on each 2000 mints, which would replace the traditional
system with this one:</p>

<p>1 to 10,000 (Gen 0)<br />
10,001 to 12,000 (Gen1) 20,000 <span style={{fontFamily: "'Poppins', sans-serif", fontSize: "18px"}}><em>$</em></span>BLOOD<br />
