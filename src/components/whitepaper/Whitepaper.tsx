                                        <p>In a world where uncertainty reigns over desolate lands and vast stretches of dangerous desert, in the middle of an unknown world, preceding a bloody war that reduced human civilization to less than nothing, vampires who resisted the apocalypse attack humans.</p>

                                        <p>Needing to rebuild a society based on their ideals, the vampires decide to use them to build an ecosystem that is favorable to them.</p>

                                        <p>Exploiting humans for survival, they no longer have to hunt but simply take human $BLOOD.
                                        From this comes an obvious obsession among the vampires: that of never having to do anything else to feed themselves.</p>

                                        <p>Their objective is clear.</p>

                                        <p>They want to perpetuate future generations of humans and vampires who will have known neither wars nor a pre-apocalyptic world of equal rights, where it is normal for vampires to dominate.</p>

                                        <p>Seeing their inferiority in strength, the humans agree to cohabit with the vampires and pay with their $BLOOD.
                                        In exchange, the vampires protect them from the outside world and live in walled castles.
                                        Some humans who wanted to escape from the vampires' yoke fled beyond the castle walls, but it seems that strange wandering creatures, feared by the vampires themselves, roam the forests.

                                        <p>From 10k to 20k, It will start to 20k $BLOOD and then all 2k minted, mint price increase 20% (12k -&gt; 24k $BLOOD / 14k -&gt; 28k $BLOOD /..... / 20k -&gt; 40k $BLOOD) 
                                        Then from 20K to 40K It will start at 40K $blood and upgrade 10% all 2k mints 
                                        ( 20k -&gt; 40k $BLOOD / 22k -&gt; 44k $BLOOD / .... / 40K -&gt; 80K $BLOOD) </p>

                                        <p>And from 40K to 50K it is still 80K $BLOOD</p>

He will pay with his own blood for being able to live in the castle & under the protection of a vampire by regularly giving him 20% (harvest) of the blood he accumulates.

                                            <li><p>If a human decided not to give his blood anymore and leave the castle, (unstake) (Can only be done if the human has accumulated 2 days worth of $BLOOD.), He must be very careful because if a vampire catches him in the act during his escapade, he will attack him with instant violence making his blood spurt to the ground (50% burn) & drink the other half (50% redistributed among all the vampires)

                                            <li><p>When a new creature (Vampire or werewolf) or human enters the territory, the wolves & vampires already present will try to kidnap them (NFT steal). If the attack is successful, a vampire or LG will take the reward for the hunt.
</p></li>
                                            <li><p>The werewolf is a rare lone hunter and one of the largest predators of strange creatures. It contains a high risk high rewards mechanic, which allows it to attack any number of vampires. The more vampires he decides to attack, the less likely he is to succeed. When the werewolf succeeds in attacking a vampire, the vampire pledges allegiance to the werewolf for 24 hours, during which time the werewolf will give the werewolf the tax back on humans.
